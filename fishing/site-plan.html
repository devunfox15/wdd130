        Colored paragraph example
      </h3>
      <p class="colored">
        John had always dreamed of catching a trophy fish, and his chance finally came on a sunny afternoon at the lake. He baited his hook with a juicy worm and cast his line into the water, waiting patiently for a bite. Hours went by without any luck, and John was starting to lose hope. Just as he was about to give up and call it a day, he felt a sharp tug on his line. His heart raced as he reeled in the fish, which fought hard and put up a good fight. Finally, after what felt like an eternity, John caught a glimpse of his catch â€“ a massive rainbow trout that glimmered in the sun. He carefully pulled the fish onto his boat, feeling a sense of pride and accomplishment. As he held the fish up for a photo, he couldn't help but smile. It was a moment he would never forget, and he knew that he would be telling the story of his epic catch for years to come.
