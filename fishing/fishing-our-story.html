   <h1 id="page_2_h1_font">This is our company's story according to Devun Durst. It started about 15 years ago when my dad, Anthony Durst, began fishing as a hobby that he really enjoyed. His passion for fishing was further enhanced when he received a free boat, and he would often spend his Saturdays out on the water, clearing his mind after a busy week of providing for our family.
    Soon, he found himself surrounded by a community of friends who shared his passion, and together they developed an idea to enter the fishing market and start their own brand. My father started his Instagram page with no followers, but over the past few years, he has grown the company to 13.9k followers. He has also released custom shirts, partnered with other swimbaits, and hosted numerous tournaments.
    However, the company is still growing and currently lacks a website. As his son, I am creating a webpage for the brand. Although things may change, our love and passion for bringing the fishing community together to enjoy our brand remains the same.
