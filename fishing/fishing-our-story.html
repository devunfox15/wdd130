   <h1 id="page_2_h1_font">This is our story as a company according to Devun Durst. It was about 15 years ago when my Dad Anthnoy Durst started fishing as a hobby that he really enjoyed.
    Although his desires were inhanced to continue more and more with this passion due to recieving a free boat. He would spend most his saturdays free in the 
    morning going out and clearing his mind from a busy week of providing for his family. Soon he found himself surounded by a community of friends and their they
    had developed an idea to get into the fishing market and start their own brand. My father started his instagram age with no followers and after these past 
    years has grown the company to 13.9k followers and has released custom shirts, partnered with other swimbaits, and has hosted numerous tournaments. Although 
    the company is still growing, it lacks a website. So as his son I am creating his webpage. Things will change here and their but the love and passion to bring 
    the fishing community together to enjoy this brand is every thing.  </h1>
